              I have been swimming since I was a child and have always loved being in the water. Although I never had formal lessons myself, I joined the swim team in high school. After high school, I missed swimming so much that I decided to become a lifeguard.

              Soon after becoming a lifeguard, I began teaching swim lessons and have continued to do so for the past several years. I teach swimming because I think it is a very important skill to have.
